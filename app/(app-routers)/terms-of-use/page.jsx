                  Our platform facilitates the certification process. However,
                  the ultimate decision regarding certification rests with the
                  participating Doctors.

                <p>
                  Certnow acts solely as a facilitator. Doctors are independent
                  professionals responsible for the medical certification
                  process. Certnow is not a healthcare provider and does not
                  provide medical advice or services. It is imperative to
                  understand that our online service has inherent limitations.
                  If you experience any symptoms that may indicate a serious or
                  urgent medical condition, or if you have concerns beyond
                  simple mental and physical symptoms, we strongly advise you to
                  seek in-person medical attention immediately. This includes
                  but is not limited to severe respiratory distress, chest pain,
                  high fever, neurological symptoms, and major injuries.
                  Certnow's services are not a substitute for emergency care or
                  comprehensive in-person medical examinations. Your health and
                  well-being are our utmost priority, and we encourage you to
                  consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough
                  assessment of any complex or emergent medical issues. By using
                  Certnow, you acknowledge and understand the limitations of
                  online consultations and agree to seek in-person medical care
                  when necessary. By the issuance of this medical certificate,
                  there is no guarantee that your medical condition will not
                  deteriorate further, and it is therefore imperative that
                  in-person medical care is sought if you are experiencing such
                  developments.
